    <!-- Attractions -->
    <section class="content content--attractions">
      <p class="content__text">One of the main highlights of Myrtle Beach is the <strong class="content__highlight">Myrtle Beach Boardwalk and Promenade</strong>, a 1.2-mile stretch of oceanfront that features shops, restaurants, arcades, and attractions.

      <p class="content__text">In addition to the boardwalk, Myrtle Beach is home to numerous amusement parks, water parks, and mini-golf courses, making it a perfect destination for families with children. <strong class="content__highlight">Family Kingdom Amusement Park</strong> and <strong class="content__highlight">MagiQuest</strong> offer hours of entertainment with rides, games, and fun attractions.

    <!-- Environment -->
    <section class="content content--environment">
      <p class="content__text">Another unique feature of Myrtle Beach is its wide array of wildlife. The area is home to various species of birds, sea turtles, and marine life. Visitors can take eco-tours to spot dolphins in the wild or participate in turtle watch programs to help protect the endangered loggerhead turtles that nest along the coast. Local wildlife organizations are working to protect the natural environment, and tourists are encouraged to follow guidelines to avoid disturbing the animals and their habitats.</p>
  
      <p class="content__text">However, like many popular tourist destinations, Myrtle Beach faces challenges related to environmental sustainability. The beauty of the area can be overshadowed by the presence of trash left behind by visitors. It's important for everyone to take responsibility and pick up after themselves to keep Myrtle Beach pristine. Reducing the use of single-use plastics, supporting local cleanup efforts, and disposing of trash properly helps protect the beach and its wildlife.</p>
  
      <p class="content__text">Along with trash concerns, Myrtle Beach is also grappling with coastal erosion. Rising sea levels and heavy tourism are contributing factors that are affecting the beach's shoreline. The local community is actively working on replenishing sand and finding sustainable ways to combat these issues. If you’re visiting Myrtle Beach, it’s essential to respect the area and be mindful of your environmental impact. By taking part in keeping the beach clean, you help ensure that Myrtle Beach remains beautiful for future generations.</p>
